The draft plan links to additional documents.


<!--
I am providing Word versions of all documents except the picture
collections. I am providing these if you want to edit the text of a
file. (Send me the changes by e-mail.) Some of the links in these Word
files will not work because the are what are called relative links,
the don't start with `http://...`. When you want to view links, use your
browser to open the corresponding file on this site.
